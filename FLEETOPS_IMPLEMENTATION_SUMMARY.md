# FleetOps Implementation Summary

**Project:** FleetOps / `fleetops-v2`  
**Product type:** Multi-tenant B2B fleet-operations SaaS for Indian fleet and bus operators  
**Currency and market:** Indian Rupees (₹), India-focused fleet workflows  
**Current published release:** [`d2cbacf8`](https://fleetops-elktaacw.manus.space/?release=d2cbacf8)  
**Prepared:** 18 August 2026

## Executive Summary

FleetOps has evolved from a primarily static frontend into a full-stack, multi-tenant fleet-operations application. The current product uses React 19, Tailwind CSS 4, Vite, tRPC, Supabase Auth, Supabase PostgreSQL, Supabase Realtime, Drizzle ORM, and Supabase Edge Functions. The application now contains persisted operational modules for vehicles, work orders, inventory, purchase orders, compliance documents, notifications, activity, financial records, billing status, maintenance automation, and organization membership.

The implementation also includes an organization-first identity journey. A first-time user creates a Superadmin account, completes organization onboarding, and enters the organization workspace. The Superadmin can invite staff through tokenized Join Organization links. Invited users receive an organization-bound signup screen with their email and organization identity already resolved, create a password, redeem the invitation, and are routed into their assigned locked workspace.

The current release has passed the local typecheck, production build, and 25 Vitest tests. Several production failures were diagnosed and corrected during implementation, including Supabase Auth trigger provisioning errors, stale onboarding metadata, null-derived `undefined.id` crashes, a dashboard summary HTTP 500, indefinite invitation requests, stale production assets, and authenticated tRPC requests returning 401. The final real-account invitation and post-login verification still requires a live Superadmin session because account credentials and email confirmation cannot be supplied autonomously.

## Product Scope and Architecture

| Layer | Implemented approach |
|---|---|
| Frontend | React 19 with Vite, Wouter routing, Tailwind CSS 4, shadcn-style UI primitives, Signal Ledger visual system |
| API contract | tRPC procedures under `/api/trpc`, with typed client usage and batched requests |
| Database | Supabase PostgreSQL accessed through Drizzle ORM and a FleetOps compatibility adapter |
| Authentication | Supabase Auth with browser session persistence, access-token transport, refresh handling, and organization-bound invitations |
| Authorization | Server-side role checks, organization scoping, assigned-vehicle checks, and PostgreSQL RLS for vehicle assignments |
| Realtime | Supabase Realtime-compatible data model and session-aware live workspace behavior |
| Automation | Supabase Edge Function and server automation for maintenance, low-stock alerts, purchase-order drafting, and document expiry workflows |
| Hosting | Published through the project’s managed web hosting at [`fleetops-elktaacw.manus.space`](https://fleetops-elktaacw.manus.space/) |
| Payments | Razorpay explicitly deferred; subscription state and billing presentation are implemented without checkout processing |

The server is organized around reusable tRPC procedures and shared database helpers. Tenant data is keyed by organization identifiers, and protected procedures derive the current FleetOps user from the Supabase access token rather than trusting organization or role values supplied by the browser.

## Implementation Journey

### 1. Frontend foundation and design system

The initial FleetOps experience was established as a Signal Ledger command center: an operational interface using ink, ivory, orange signal accents, route-line geometry, persistent navigation, and data-dense workspace cards. The frontend was then converted from static or demo-oriented presentation into backend-backed screens. Hardcoded dashboard metrics and demo arrays were removed from authenticated views, and visible actions were either connected to persisted procedures or removed.

The application gained a consistent loading, empty, and error-state strategy. A static HTML boot shell was added to `client/index.html` so slow JavaScript delivery does not present a blank page, and a no-JavaScript fallback explains why the application cannot continue without client execution. A regression test now ensures these boot elements remain in the production HTML.

### 2. Database and backend migration

The backend was migrated fully to Drizzle ORM while preserving Supabase PostgreSQL, Supabase Auth, Realtime compatibility, and RLS. Prisma packages, generated clients, Prisma schema files, and runtime Prisma imports were removed. The active adapter maps FleetOps models to PostgreSQL tables and provides the query operations used by the application, including tenant-filtered reads, counts, aggregates, creates, updates, deletes, and transactions.

The tenant-aware data model covers organizations, users, invitations, vehicles, vehicle assignments, components, odometer logs, work orders, inventory parts, work-order parts, vendors, purchase orders, financial records, documents, notifications, DVIR inspections, and fuel logs. A dedicated `vehicle_assignments` table was added for driver isolation, including organization, vehicle, driver, active-state, audit, foreign-key, index, and RLS support.

### 3. Authentication, provisioning, and onboarding

Supabase Auth is the active identity system. The first-run flow is:

1. A user creates a Superadmin account with name, email, and password.
2. Supabase Auth creates the identity.
3. The Auth provisioning path creates the organization and user records with explicit UUIDs, trial dates, currency, limits, and audit fields.
4. The Superadmin completes organization onboarding.
5. The application refreshes Supabase metadata and routes the user into the Command Center and Team workspace.

The Supabase Auth trigger and provisioning logic were hardened after production signup failures. Required organization trial and currency fields, explicit identifiers, and `updatedAt` values are populated consistently. Onboarding completion now preserves safe existing metadata, updates organization information, refreshes the active session, and surfaces metadata-update failures rather than silently continuing with stale state.

A later dashboard failure was traced to the Drizzle compatibility adapter ignoring Prisma-style relation includes. `getFleetOpsUserFromRequest` authenticated the user but did not hydrate `ctx.fleetopsUser.org`; `dashboard.summary` then attempted to read organization fields and returned HTTP 500. The current implementation explicitly loads the organization by `orgId` before returning the FleetOps user.

### 4. Invitation and invited-user joining

Team invitation creation is Superadmin-only and persists an invitation token, organization, intended role, status, timestamps, and delivery result. The server generates a Join Organization URL and attempts Supabase Auth email delivery. When an approved email provider is unavailable, the UI does not claim that an email was sent; it exposes the generated link or token for controlled fallback sharing.

The invited-user flow is organization-bound:

> Invitation email → Join Organization URL → organization and email lookup → prefilled signup form → password creation → Supabase signup → invitation redemption → role-specific workspace.

The Join Organization page resolves organization and email from the invitation token. The user cannot replace the organization or assign a different role. Wrong authenticated sessions are rejected, and a redeemed invitation carries the assigned role into the new FleetOps membership. Invalid or expired tokens produce a bounded unavailable state rather than a generic unrestricted signup screen.

Invitation creation also has bounded client and server behavior. The client prevents overlapping retries, times out a pending request, shows a visible retry path, and reports persisted success, email-delivery status, manual-token fallback, or database failure.

### 5. RBAC and workspace isolation

FleetOps uses server-authoritative authorization in addition to frontend navigation guards. The role matrix is designed so each role sees only its operational mandate:

| Role | Dedicated workspace scope | Restricted areas |
|---|---|---|
| Superadmin / Organization Owner | Executive command center, organization governance, Team, billing status, organization-wide analytics, P&L, compliance oversight | None within the organization, subject to trial and write restrictions |
| Fleet Manager | Fleet operations, vehicles, work orders, maintenance coordination, operational analytics | Superadmin-only governance and sensitive billing controls |
| Inventory Manager | Parts, stock levels, reorder workflow, vendors, purchase orders, inventory automation | Financial accounting, Team governance, driver-only actions |
| Mechanic / Technician | Assigned maintenance operations, components, work orders, service records, odometer-related maintenance actions | Team governance, billing, organization-wide financial data |
| Driver | Assigned vehicles, DVIR inspections, odometer submissions, fuel logs, receipt/photo proof | Team, billing, inventory administration, P&L, organization-wide financial data |
| Accountant | Financial records, per-vehicle P&L, distance-based cost per kilometer, accounting views | Team governance, inventory administration, compliance mutation authority |

Direct routes are guarded, navigation entries are role-filtered, and distinct Fleet Manager and Mechanic entry views provide role-specific messaging and operational actions. The server rejects unauthorized procedure calls even if a user manually enters a URL or invokes an endpoint directly.

Driver isolation is more specific than role hiding. Driver list and mutation procedures check the assignment table and reject access to vehicles that are not actively assigned to the current driver. PostgreSQL RLS policies were added to the assignment table so organization and driver boundaries exist below the application layer as well.

### 6. Operational modules

The following operational areas are implemented against persisted data rather than demo arrays:

| Module | Current capabilities |
|---|---|
| Vehicles | List, create, update, status, odometer data, component relationships, tenant filtering, driver assignment scope |
| Work orders | List, create, update, completion, parts used, inventory deduction, validation, role permissions |
| Components | List, create, update, delete, vehicle relationship, service-life and alert thresholds |
| Inventory | Part listing, quantity and reorder thresholds, stock-affecting workflows, low-stock detection, purchase-order drafting |
| Purchase orders | Vendor and part relationships, draft automation, role-aware management |
| Compliance | Document creation, upload metadata, renewal/update actions, expiry tracking, alerts |
| Driver operations | DVIR inspections, manual odometer submissions, fuel logging, receipt/photo proof workflow |
| Finance | Financial records, expense totals, per-vehicle P&L, distance-based CPK calculations, INR formatting |
| Notifications | Persisted notifications, unread counts, mark-read actions, maintenance and stock alerts |
| Activity | Recent activity presentation and tenant-scoped activity records |
| Billing | Trial and subscription state, vehicle/team utilization, capacity presentation; Razorpay checkout remains deferred |
| Search | Quick Find across persisted vehicles and work orders with result and empty states |

The product uses Indian Rupee formatting throughout financial presentation. Odometer validation rejects negative readings and applies the time-aware 1,000 km/day jump rule. Completion and inventory mutations are persisted and trigger relevant downstream automation.

### 7. Automation and maintenance

Maintenance automation evaluates vehicle and component conditions, creates or drafts operational follow-up, and notifies users. Low-stock evaluation uses per-part reorder thresholds and drafts purchase orders rather than only displaying a notification. Document expiry automation produces compliance alerts. The Supabase Edge Function was hardened for service-role authorization, scheduled execution, and tenant-safe evaluation. The recurring maintenance callback still requires final confirmation in the deployed Supabase scheduling environment.

### 8. Production incidents resolved

| Incident | Resolution |
|---|---|
| Supabase signup database error | Corrected Auth trigger defaults, UUID handling, trial/currency fields, and audit timestamps; added integration coverage |
| Login did not enter onboarding | Added authoritative onboarding state and metadata refresh after authentication |
| `undefined.id` render crash | Added null-safe organization, vehicle, work-order, procurement, driver, and resource-row guards |
| Slow or blank initial page | Added explicit connection/loading states and static HTML boot/no-JavaScript fallback |
| Team route returned to login | Preserved Supabase session across navigation and added one-time refresh on 401 |
| Invitation stayed in Creating state | Added required invitation identifiers and timestamps, server/client bounds, retry state, persisted token, and visible delivery result |
| Join route served stale assets | Added release markers and republished fresh asset revisions |
| `dashboard.summary` returned HTTP 500 | Explicitly hydrated the organization relation in the Supabase-to-FleetOps user loader |
| Protected requests returned 401 | Confirmed sign-in session before queries, refreshed it, hardened bearer extraction, and attached the access token at the tRPC batch-link layer |
| Permissions-policy unload warning | Identified as unrelated hosting-page noise; it does not cause the FleetOps API failures |

The final authenticated 401 issue is addressed in release `d2cbacf8`, but the browser must still complete a real Superadmin retry to verify that the published session reaches the Team request successfully.

## Validation and Published Checkpoints

| Checkpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `6b29f1d4` | Non-Razorpay workflow expansion including onboarding, automation, driver, compliance, and accounting features |
| `a1cfc770` | Supabase Auth trigger and signup provisioning fix |
| `0ed7f61a` | Null-safe `undefined.id` crash protections |
| `c1f7c6f9` | Invitation required fields and bounded client timeout |
| `8d1aced2` | RBAC, driver assignment isolation, role governance, and invitation regression work |
| `79a5280e` | Secure invited-user Join Organization flow and distinct role workspaces |
| `96e61a24` | Static boot screen and no-JavaScript white-screen resilience |
| `5344cc05` | Boot-shell regression guard and measured production loading investigation |
| `8d5c8b2d` | Dashboard summary organization-hydration fix and 25-test release |
| `8505fc46` | Sign-in confirmation, refresh, and robust server bearer extraction |
| `d2cbacf8` | tRPC batch-link Authorization header fix; current published release |

The current automated validation result is **25 Vitest tests passing**, a clean TypeScript check, and a successful production build. The build emits a large-bundle warning because the main JavaScript asset remains above 500 kB after minification; this is a performance optimization opportunity, not a build failure.

## Deferred Scope and Remaining Verification

Razorpay checkout and payment processing were intentionally deferred. The application exposes trial and subscription state and presents billing capacity, but it does not claim to process paid upgrades until Razorpay credentials, webhook handling, subscription lifecycle, and production payment verification are separately configured.

The remaining product verification is account-dependent rather than an unimplemented UI path. A real Superadmin session must confirm the following sequence on the current release: sign in, load the dashboard without 500 or 401 errors, open Team without a session loop, create an invitation, observe the persisted Join Organization link or explicit delivery state, open the link as the invited user, complete the organization-bound signup, and verify automatic routing to the assigned workspace. The maintenance Edge Function scheduler also requires a final deployed callback check.

## Current Status

FleetOps is a published, full-stack product implementation with multi-tenant persistence, Supabase Auth, role and workspace isolation, operational fleet modules, automation, INR financial workflows, organization-bound invitations, and production resilience fixes. The application is not represented as payment-complete because Razorpay remains deferred, and the final live-account walkthrough is intentionally kept open until the real Superadmin and invited-user sessions are exercised end to end.
