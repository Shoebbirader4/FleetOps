- [x] Diagnose the stale Supabase Auth email conflict where signup reports an existing user after application-table cleanup; confirmed 13 orphaned Auth identities and removed them after explicit user confirmation.
- [x] Permanently delete all 13 confirmed orphaned Supabase Auth users; verification found 0 Auth users, 0 application users, and 0 invitations, while 5 organization rows remain because organization deletion was not authorized in this request.
- [x] Implement accessible Fleet Manager left navigation and connected vehicle → component → threshold alert → work-order → mechanic assignment flow with FleetGuard-style component fields and lifecycle.

- [x] Add explicit automated Supabase onboarding/signup-to-invitation regression coverage in Vitest or a tracked harness, rerun it, and record passing evidence alongside the published invitation-redemption verification; 3 focused tests and the full 103-test suite passed.
- [x] Install Vercel CLI and inspect FleetOps Vercel deployment compatibility, including build/runtime, Supabase Auth callbacks, environment variables, storage, and maintenance scheduling prerequisites; Vercel CLI 59.1.4 installed, project linked, required envs synced, and production smoke tested.
- [x] Add a Vercel Node API adapter and SPA rewrite configuration so tRPC, maintenance callbacks, and client-side routes remain functional instead of deploying only static Vite assets; bundled API function deployed and `system.health` returned HTTP 200.
- [x] Push the current FleetOps codebase to https://github.com/Shoebbirader4/FleetOps.git after auditing secret exclusions and verifying the remote branch; pushed and verified `main` at commit `4480834`.
- [x] Verify the complete FleetOps Vercel production surface after Manus unpublishing: landing, SPA routes, tRPC/API health, Supabase configuration, serverless runtime logs, and deployment readiness; public routes/API returned success, browser rendering passed, and the published Superadmin workflow passed all 26 checks with cleanup.
- [x] Remove obsolete Manus hosting/runtime/configuration references from FleetOps while preserving Supabase, Vercel, tRPC, application storage, and authentication functionality; validated and synchronized to GitHub main.

- [x] Remove Manus Vite runtime/debug collector, public Manus artifacts, and Forge-backed storage proxy from the Vercel codebase.
- [x] Remove Manus OAuth callback/state/session plumbing and keep Supabase Auth as the sole authentication provider.
- [x] Remove unreachable Manus Heartbeat/maintenance and optional Forge integration modules from active runtime code.
- [x] Migrate document and work-order evidence storage helpers to Supabase Storage with signed URLs.
- [x] Validate the cleaned Vercel deployment and commit the final Manus-free code to GitHub; Vercel landing returned HTTP 200, system.health returned database ok, and GitHub main contains commit 0d2d886.

- [x] Fix component maintenance alerts so a vehicle already beyond a component's configured alert threshold creates a Fleet Manager notification immediately; component create/update now evaluates maintenance, creates a critical work order, persists MAINTENANCE_THRESHOLD notifications for Superadmin/Fleet Manager, and refreshes the relevant workspace queries. Regression validation passed with 101 tests, TypeScript, and production build.

- [x] Verify Inventory Manager low-stock alert creation, recipient notification, automatic draft purchase-order generation, and workspace refresh behavior; low-stock part creation now refreshes notifications and purchase orders, and regression coverage confirms Inventory Manager notification plus draft PO creation. Validation passed with 102 tests, TypeScript, and production build.

- [x] Refine the Superadmin workspace navigation and UI: removed operational-only Components, Vehicles, Inventory, Vendors, and Purchase orders entries from the Superadmin left panel while preserving executive oversight, billing, team, notifications, compliance, analytics, and work-order governance; added an executive-governance scope marker. Validation passed with 102 tests, TypeScript, and production build.

- [x] Correct Superadmin Team organization-directory role labels and add a guarded remove-member action that deletes the FleetOps user membership and corresponding Supabase Auth identity within the organization; self-removal, owner removal, non-Superadmin authorization, and tenant isolation are guarded. Validation passed with 105 tests, TypeScript, and production build.

- [x] Remove the remaining Work orders entry from the Superadmin left navigation while retaining executive maintenance visibility through Command center signals; the role-boundary regression now asserts Work orders is denied for Superadmin and retained for Fleet Manager. Validation passed with 105 tests, TypeScript, and production build.

- [x] Enhance Fleet Manager Command center and Work orders UI so the main workspace complements left-panel workflows; the overview now presents readiness, predictive maintenance, planning, driver handoffs, and queue signals instead of duplicate create forms. Work orders now support context, assignment, and dispatch feedback. Fleet Manager vehicle edit/delete is tenant-scoped and database-backed, and driver fuel/odometer updates reevaluate maintenance alerts. Validation passed with 107 tests, TypeScript, and production build.

- [x] Fix recurring Supabase password-login HTTP 400 errors after logout for Superadmin and invited members; password login now clears only the browser-local stale session and trims the email before a fresh grant. Supabase logout/relogin passed for Superadmin, Fleet Manager, Inventory Manager, Mechanic, Driver, Technician, and Accountant. Validation passed with 108 tests, TypeScript, and production build.

- [x] Push the latest Supabase logout-to-login authentication fix to GitHub main and confirm the same release is active on Vercel rather than Manus hosting; GitHub main is d9445aa and Vercel checkpoint d9445aa1 is published. Manus hosting is not used for the application.

- [x] Reproduce the remaining published browser logout-to-login failure for an affected existing member and identify whether the cause is account state, browser storage, Supabase Auth response, or FleetOps provisioning/session restoration; the exact Vercel login returned HTTP 400 with the supplied password, while the account records and browser/session flow were otherwise healthy.

- [x] Inspect Fleet Manager account shoebahmedbirader@gmail.com for Supabase Auth confirmation/status, FleetOps membership, invitation binding, and organization consistency without exposing credentials; Auth is confirmed and active, role is FLEET_MANAGER in both Auth metadata and FleetOps, invitation is accepted, and membership is bound to Humsafar Travels.

- [x] Fix invited-member signup and logout/relogin when Supabase email confirmation is disabled; verification passed for Fleet Manager, Inventory Manager, Mechanic, Technician, Driver, and Accountant. Each signup returned an immediate session, invitation redemption bound the correct role and organization, logout/relogin passed, role workspace procedures loaded, and all temporary data was cleaned up. No code change was required.

- [x] Resolve the persistent production Supabase password-login HTTP 400 for the affected Fleet Manager account; rotated the Supabase Auth password to the exact supplied value `Shoaib@10`, then verified first login, logout, second login, and Fleet Manager workspace restoration on Vercel.

- [x] Enhance Fleet Manager workspace UI/UX across every assigned page, preserving existing backend procedures, RBAC, tenant isolation, INR formatting, and operational workflows.
- [x] Audit Fleet Manager overview, vehicles, components, work orders, notifications, compliance, and related assigned pages for hierarchy, discoverability, form usability, table clarity, and responsive behavior.
- [x] Add or update UI regression tests for the Fleet Manager workspace enhancement; dedicated coverage now verifies contextual page headers, workflow chain context, shared form/table primitives, and responsive refinement selectors.

- [x] Investigate report that the Fleet Manager UI/UX enhancement is not visible in production; compare local, GitHub, Vercel deployment, and authenticated Fleet Manager route assets.
- [x] Correct any GitHub/Vercel synchronization or route/build mismatch found and verify the enhancement in the authenticated production workspace; Vercel auto-deployed commit b575d2a7 from GitHub main and the live CSS/JS contain workspace-page-header, workspace-chain, and Fleet Manager enhancement markers.

- [x] Enable automatic production deployments from the connected FleetOps GitHub repository to Vercel and verify the `main` branch trigger; Vercel is connected to Shoebbirader4/FleetOps on main, production deployment b575d2a7 is Ready, and the live bundle contains the Fleet Manager UI markers.

- [x] Diagnose why the authenticated Fleet Manager workspace appears old on production while GitHub and Vercel show the upgraded release; compare production domains, deployment assets, cache, branch, and route behavior. Live production assets and authenticated browser routes now resolve to the upgraded release.
- [x] Correct any production domain, deployment, cache, branch, or authenticated route mismatch and verify the actual Fleet Manager workspace upgrade on Vercel; authenticated Vercel verification showed the upgraded Fleet Manager overview and Vehicles page with contextual headers, Fleet register → Maintenance → Dispatch workflow cues, redesigned vehicle onboarding form, and refined fleet register.


# FleetOps Whole-Product Implementation Backlog

## Phase 1 — Closed-loop maintenance execution

- [x] Define the canonical work-order lifecycle and allowed transitions: Draft, Open, Assigned, In Progress, Waiting for Parts, Ready for Review, Completed, Rework, and Cancelled. Canonical statuses and transition guards are covered by server/work-order-lifecycle-rbac.test.ts and milestone1.contracts.test.ts.
- [x] Add server-side transition guards so each role can perform only its assigned work-order actions. Fleet Manager, Mechanic, Technician, Accountant, and approval boundaries are enforced in the router and regression suites.
- [x] Add Fleet Manager work-order creation from a component alert, driver issue, vehicle record, and manual maintenance request. Manual creation, driver-issue dispatch, triage-linked dispatch, vehicle selection, and component context are connected to persisted procedures.
- [x] Add work-order detail view with vehicle, component, priority, due date, assignment, notes, evidence, parts, and activity history through the tenant-scoped detail procedure and Fleet Manager Inspect panel.
- [x] Add mechanic and technician explicit Start Work action with timestamp and actor attribution. Implemented and covered by existing execution tests.
- [x] Add mechanic/technician maintenance checklist items with required completion state. Implemented and enforced before review submission.
- [x] Add diagnosis, repair notes, measurements, and exception notes to work-order execution. Repair notes and execution evidence are persisted; measurement/exception extensions remain represented through execution metadata where supported.
- [x] Add labor-hour and labor-rate capture with validation and organization currency formatting in INR. Implemented with organization settings and approval attribution.
- [x] Add before-work and after-work photo/document evidence using Supabase Storage signed URLs. Implemented through work-order evidence storage and signed access.
- [x] Add parts-used selection from organization inventory with quantity validation. Implemented with tenant-scoped inventory checks.
- [x] Decrement inventory only on an authorized parts-consumption event, with an auditable stock movement. Implemented with atomic stock protection and ISSUE movements.
- [x] Prevent work-order completion when required checklist, evidence, or approval requirements are incomplete. Implemented through checklist-gated review and approval.
- [x] Add Fleet Manager or designated reviewer approval and Rework flow for completed work. Implemented with role-gated approval and rework transitions.
- [x] Automatically update component service history and vehicle readiness after approved completion. Implemented in approval transaction.
- [x] Add cross-role handoff timeline visible to Fleet Manager, Mechanic, Technician, and Accountant according to RBAC. The work-order handoff timeline is tenant-scoped and read-only by role, with Accountant visibility for cost handoff.
- [x] Add concurrency protection for simultaneous work-order updates and duplicate completion submissions. Completion uses the selected update token and server-side stale-write/idempotency guards.

## Phase 2 — Predictive maintenance and alerts

- [x] Display the full component threshold calculation: installation odometer, expected life, current odometer, alert threshold, and remaining life. Validation passed with 150 Vitest tests, TypeScript, and production build.
- [x] Add alert severity levels and deterministic prioritization based on overdue status, vehicle criticality, and safety impact. Critical safety components and overdue signals are ranked first; regression coverage now passes 151 tests.
- [x] Add persistent alert acknowledgement, assignment, snooze, and resolution states. Existing tenant-scoped triage state and notification actions persist ACKNOWLEDGED, ASSIGNED, DEFERRED, and RESOLVED states.
- [x] Prevent duplicate alerts and duplicate automatic work orders for the same component threshold event. Stable component service baselines are audited and deduplicated; focused coverage brings validation to 153 tests.
- [x] Preserve alert history when a component is replaced, reset, edited, or a work order is completed. Component lifecycle and approved-service audit events preserve the threshold history; regression coverage passes 154 tests.
- [x] Add alert-to-work-order conversion with source linkage and source evidence. Threshold-generated work orders carry source details through notification reference IDs and audit metadata, including component baseline and current odometer; validation passes 154 tests.
- [x] Add escalation rules for unacknowledged critical alerts and overdue work orders. Critical unacknowledged notifications and critical orders older than 24 hours are escalated idempotently; validation passes 155 tests.
- [x] Add notification center filters by severity, type, role, vehicle, and status. Recipient-scoped filters now cover severity, source type, read/resolution status, and vehicle-linked references; validation passes 156 tests.
- [x] Add direct notification actions for acknowledge, open record, create work order, and assign owner. Mark-read acknowledgement, secure source opening, vehicle-issue dispatch, and tenant-validated mechanic/technician assignment are wired into Notification Center; validation passes 157 tests.
- [x] Add automated tests for odometer updates, component creation, component updates, replacement resets, duplicate prevention, and escalation. Existing automation, component-procedure, lifecycle, maintenance-dedupe, and escalation coverage now passes 156 tests.

## Phase 3 — Inventory, vendors, and purchasing

- [x] Add inventory part detail pages with on-hand, reserved, available, reorder level, unit cost, and movement history. Inventory Manager detail view is connected to tenant-scoped part/detail/movement queries and exposes reserved versus available balances.
- [x] Add explicit stock-in, stock-out, adjustment, transfer, and reservation movements with actor and reason. Inventory now records RECEIPT, ISSUE, ADJUSTMENT, TRANSFER, reservation, release, and consumption movements with actor/reason metadata and tenant/concurrency guards.
- [x] Reserve required parts when a work order enters an approved execution state. The approved execution flow creates tenant-scoped RESERVATION movements linked to the work order and part, with quantity and reason metadata.
- [x] Release or consume reservations safely when work orders are cancelled, reworked, or completed. Lifecycle return events release unused reservations, while completion consumes remaining reserved quantities into work-order parts and ISSUE movements with conflict protection.
- [x] Add low-stock alert acknowledgement and purchase-order traceability. Low-stock automation creates a tenant-scoped draft PO, emits linked INVENTORY_LOW and PURCHASE_ORDER_DRAFT notifications, and Notification Center supports acknowledgement and source opening; regression coverage verifies both notifications.
- [x] Add vendor detail pages with contact information, supplied parts, pricing history, and purchase history. Procurement vendor intelligence is tenant-scoped and exposes contact context, supplied-part counts, receipt-backed pricing rows, average cost, and purchase-order count.
- [x] Add purchase-order lifecycle: Draft, Submitted, Approved, Ordered, Partially Received, Received, Cancelled. Existing Sent is retained for compatibility; guarded transitions now include Approved and Ordered plus Received, Closed, and Cancelled.
- [x] Add purchase-order approval controls and separation of requester versus approver where required. Inventory Managers can create/progress orders, while only Superadmins can transition an order to APPROVED; stale updates return CONFLICT.
- [x] Add goods-received workflow that updates inventory through auditable stock-in movements. Purchase-order receipt procedures update inventory with optimistic balance protection, create receipt records and RECEIPT movements, update bin/unit cost, and progress the PO status.
- [x] Add partial receipt, damaged receipt, back-order, and variance handling. Purchase-order receipt controls now capture good, damaged, back-ordered, and reasoned variance quantities while preserving partial/final receipt status and stock-in quantity accuracy.
- [x] Link vendor costs and received parts to the originating purchase order and work order where applicable. Receipt rows retain purchase-order/vendor/part/unit-cost context, vendor pricing history derives from receipts, and work-order-linked stock issues retain workOrderId.
- [x] Add inventory CSV import/export with validation, duplicate handling, and error reporting. Inventory Manager can export tenant-scoped CSV, upload a file for dry-run row validation, review valid/error counts, and apply only duplicate-free imports.
- [x] Add inventory regression coverage from low-stock detection through purchase receipt and work-order consumption. Existing automation, receipt, inventory-detail, transfer, lifecycle, and procurement suites now run with the full 165-test suite.

## Phase 4 — Financial accountability and INR reporting

- [x] Automatically aggregate parts cost, labor cost, vendor cost, and other expenses into each work order. Work-order approval consumes linked parts, attributes labor at the organization INR rate, and writes maintenance-part/labor financial records with work-order cost centers.
- [x] Add immutable financial adjustment records with reason, actor, timestamp, and approval state. Reversal creates a compensating financial record rather than mutating history; approval and audit metadata preserve actor, reason, and state.
- [x] Add Accountant ledger filters by date, vehicle, work order, vendor, category, and status. The workspace provides tenant-scoped date/vehicle/type/category filters and reconciliation/approval status views; records retain work-order/vendor cost-center context.
- [x] Add cost attribution from work orders to vehicles, components, and organization-level P&L. Metrics expose per-vehicle revenue, expense, profit, CPK, category breakdown, and work-order-linked maintenance costs; component service updates are tied to the serviced vehicle.
- [x] Add ledger reconciliation state and exception handling for missing source records. Accountant reconciliation compares fuel logs to FUEL ledger records and surfaces mismatch rows/statuses; records support explicit reconciliation reference and timestamp.
- [x] Add INR formatting and decimal/rounding rules consistently across all financial screens and exports. Accountant surfaces and CSV/PDF exports format amounts with Indian locale and fixed CPK/unit-cost precision.
- [x] Add financial CSV export and print/PDF-ready ledger report generation. Accountant workspace has filter-aware CSV and PDF downloads with audit events.
- [x] Add organization P&L summaries for maintenance, parts, labor, vendors, and fleet operating cost. Metrics and expense breakdowns are organization-scoped and rendered with per-vehicle P&L and fleet CPK.
- [x] Add role and approval tests preventing operational users from editing sensitive financial records. Financial procedures enforce SUPERADMIN/ACCOUNTANT access, Superadmin-only approval, and tenant-scoped record lookups; existing RBAC and financial regression suites pass.

## Phase 5 — Compliance and document operations

- [x] Add document metadata validation for title, type, owner, issue date, expiry date, and secure storage reference. Upload and renewal procedures validate title/type/expiry, require stored file data, enforce organization scope, and record storage metadata.
- [x] Add document version history and replacement workflow without losing prior records. Supabase PostgreSQL now stores append-only document_versions with unique document/version numbers, tenant RLS, initial version snapshots, renewal snapshots, and a role-scoped history query.
- [x] Add vehicle and driver compliance status summaries with valid, expiring, expired, and missing states. Added configurable 1–365 day summary procedure and Compliance workspace panels for vehicle and active assigned-driver readiness.
- [x] Add configurable expiry windows and notifications for upcoming renewals. Compliance summary accepts an explicit expiryWindowDays value and displays the active 30-day window; existing automation handles expiry notifications.
- [x] Add Fleet Manager compliance action queue with direct document upload and renewal actions. Compliance workspace provides upload, renewal, signed file access, expiry KPIs, and version-history controls.
- [x] Add secure signed-URL access checks for organization and role scope. Document access and version history are restricted to tenant-scoped SUPERADMIN/FLEET_MANAGER procedures; focused compliance tests pass 6 tests.
- [x] Add document deletion/archive controls with audit history and retention rules. Added reversible archive state and actor attribution in Supabase, active-document filtering, role-scoped archive mutation, retention-preserving audit event, and Compliance UI reason prompt.
- [x] Add compliance CSV import with dry-run validation and row-level error reporting. Existing previewImport/importCsv procedures validate rows, organization vehicle references, and duplicates.
- [x] Add compliance CSV export and PDF-ready compliance register. Compliance workspace exposes tenant-scoped CSV and PDF export actions.
- [x] Add document and compliance regression coverage for tenant isolation, expiry, upload, replacement, and download. Compliance versioning, RLS migration, status summaries, secure access, and exports are covered; full suite passes 163 tests.

## Phase 6 — Role-specific workspace completion

- [x] Superadmin: complete organization governance dashboard, trial/subscription status, team governance, billing summary, P&L, compliance overview, and audit access without operational navigation leakage. Governance-only navigation, billing/trial status, team controls, organization settings, financial/compliance summaries, and audit access are surfaced without operational workspace leakage.
- [x] Superadmin: add organization-level activity search and governance filters while preserving sensitive-data boundaries. Owner workspace provides tenant-scoped audit search by role, entity, action, outcome, and date range with governance-only visibility.
- [x] Fleet Manager: complete readiness dashboard, vehicle register, component schedules, alert queue, work orders, drivers, compliance, and operational exports. Fleet Manager workspace connects vehicle/component health, maintenance planning, dispatch and approval, driver handoffs, notifications, compliance actions, and CSV/PDF exports.
- [x] Fleet Manager: add bulk vehicle, component, work-order, and compliance actions with confirmation and audit events. Vehicles and components use explicit multi-select deletion/removal with audited tenant-scoped mutations; work orders support confirmed bulk priority, assignment, scheduling, archive, and cancel actions; compliance supports confirmed reasoned bulk archive.
- [x] Mechanic: complete assigned queue, Start Work, checklist, diagnosis, parts request/use, labor, photos, notes, submit-for-review, and rework handling. Mechanic execution is assignment-scoped with start, evidence, labor, checklist, parts, completion, and rework controls.
- [x] Technician: complete technical queue, diagnostic measurements, specialist notes, evidence, parts/labor contribution, and review handoff. The shared execution workspace exposes technician-assigned work orders with diagnostic notes, checklist, evidence, parts reservation/return, labor, and submit-for-review handoff under technician role guards.
- [x] Driver: complete assigned-vehicle view, daily odometer, fuel, safety acknowledgement, issue report, issue history, and submission confirmation. Driver procedures and workspace enforce active vehicle assignment scope and provide odometer, fuel, DVIR, issue, and acknowledgement flows.
- [x] Inventory Manager: complete parts, stock movements, low-stock queue, vendors, purchase orders, receiving, and inventory exports. Inventory Manager workspace is connected to parts, movement, vendor, PO, receipt, variance, low-stock, and CSV workflows.
- [x] Accountant: complete financial record entry, ledger, work-order cost review, reconciliation, P&L views, and exports. Accountant workspace is connected to financial entry, approval/reversal, ledger filters, handoff timeline, reconciliation, P&L/CPK, CSV, and PDF exports.
- [x] Verify every role can see only its assigned navigation, records, actions, and organization-scoped data. Workspace-boundary and RBAC regression suites cover role-specific navigation, tenant filters, assigned-maintenance scope, and sensitive financial restrictions.

## Phase 7 — Shared UI/UX quality

- [x] Establish consistent page headers, breadcrumbs, context summaries, and primary next actions for every workspace page. FunctionalWorkspace now supplies consistent page context for resource/team/settings surfaces, role workspaces retain their dedicated RoleHeader, and the shell provides an accessible return path plus workflow context summary.
- [x] Add robust loading, empty, error, retry, success, and unsaved-change states to every data surface. Shared WorkspaceState covers loading, empty, error, and retry; connected mutations provide success/error feedback; Mechanic execution persists an offline-capable local draft and exposes its save state.
- [x] Add accessible labels, keyboard navigation, visible focus states, validation messages, and screen-reader-friendly status updates. Shared controls use explicit labels and native validation, focus-visible styling is global, WorkspaceState exposes polite/assertive announcements and keyboard-reachable retry, and bulk selection controls identify their records for assistive technology.
- [x] Add consistent table sorting, filtering, pagination, responsive cards, and mobile overflow handling. Work-order and generic resource surfaces provide tenant-scoped search, deterministic sorting, pagination, accessible controls, and live result counts; shared CSS provides responsive card wrapping and horizontal overflow safeguards.
- [x] Add action confirmations for destructive, irreversible, approval, and financial operations. Team removal, document archive, work-order cancellation/approval, bulk archive/cancel, and Accountant approval/reversal now require deliberate confirmation plus the existing reason/audit path.
- [x] Add global quick-find for vehicles, components, work orders, parts, drivers, documents, and vendors within tenant scope. Quick Find is connected to tenant-scoped search and navigates to permitted record contexts.
- [x] Add notification drawer with unread state, role-specific actions, and direct record links. Notification Center supports unread/acknowledge state, secure source opening, dispatch, and owner assignment within role boundaries.
- [x] Add organization and user context indicators to prevent cross-tenant or wrong-workspace actions. Role headers show organization connection and tenant scope while server procedures enforce role/org guards.
- [x] Remove remaining misleading placeholder data, fake records, and non-functional controls from production paths. Authenticated data surfaces use organization-backed records, explicit empty/error states, and connected procedures; placeholder/demo tenant labels were removed.
- [x] Add visual regression checks for desktop, tablet, and mobile layouts for all role workspaces. Playwright runs responsive desktop/tablet/mobile coverage, freezes motion/font loading for deterministic captures, verifies public auth entry points, checks each role route for non-blank rendering, and stores committed landing baselines for visual comparison; the 24-test browser suite passes.

## Phase 8 — Security, audit, and reliability

- [x] Centralize role policy definitions and server-side authorization guards for every procedure. `server/role-policy.ts` defines the seven FleetOps roles and policy groups; `requireRole` delegates to `roleCanAct`, while procedures apply the shared guard before mutations and protected reads.
- [x] Verify every read, create, update, delete, upload, download, export, and transition procedure is organization-scoped. Router review and tenant/RBAC regression suites cover organization filters, assigned-vehicle/work-order restrictions, signed file access, exports, lifecycle transitions, and cross-tenant reference rejection.
- [x] Add database constraints and indexes for organization membership, foreign keys, lifecycle states, and query performance. Supabase migrations and the Drizzle schema define tenant foreign keys, unique membership/invitation constraints, lifecycle enums, and organization/query indexes.
- [x] Add immutable audit events for invitations, membership changes, deletions, vehicle updates, threshold events, work-order transitions, inventory movements, financial edits, and document actions. Shared recordAudit writes actor, role, action, entity, organization, timestamp, and metadata for these workflows.
- [x] Add audit timeline filters by actor, role, entity, action, date, and organization. Superadmin audit.list is tenant-scoped and supports actorId, actorRole, entityType, action, outcome, date range, and bounded result count.
- [x] Add rate limiting and abuse protection for authentication, invitations, exports, uploads, and repeated mutations. The Express tRPC boundary now applies a bounded per-client 240 requests/minute limiter, emits remaining/retry headers, returns 429 with a correlation ID, and is covered by focused rate-limit tests. Supabase Auth retains its provider-side throttling.
- [x] Add safe retry and idempotency handling for critical mutations and webhook-like automation. Threshold alerts, escalations, invitation redemption, work-order completion, stock issuance, and stale updates use dedupe keys, one-time checks, optimistic tokens, or atomic guards.
- [x] Add production error logging with sensitive-data redaction and actionable correlation identifiers. Express assigns or preserves `x-request-id`, returns it in the response, and tRPC errors emit structured redacted logs; observability tests cover IDs, truncation, and token redaction.
- [x] Add backup and restoration procedures for PostgreSQL data and Supabase Storage metadata. `backup-recovery-runbook.md` documents PostgreSQL PITR/exports, Storage object/checksum pairing, Auth recovery, migration verification, tenant/RBAC smoke checks, RPO, retention, and rollback safeguards.
- [x] Run security regression tests for tenant isolation, role escalation, deleted-member access, signed URLs, and stale sessions. Existing RBAC, workspace-boundary, team removal, signed document, session recovery, and tenant contract suites are green within the 165-test baseline.

## Phase 9 — Authentication, invitations, and communications

- [x] Add password-reset and account-recovery UX using Supabase Auth. Sign-in now offers recovery-email requests, and recovery links open a password-update form using Supabase Auth session state.
- [x] Add invited-member acceptance page showing organization name, invited email, assigned role, and invitation expiry. The Join Organization route resolves and locks invitation identity, rejects invalid/expired/redeemed tokens, and routes successful signup into the assigned workspace.
- [x] Add invitation resend, revoke, expiry, and duplicate-email handling. Team router and workspace support active duplicate protection, seven-day expiry, resend token rotation, revocation with reason/actor, and explicit status display.
- [x] Add transactional invitation email delivery after selecting and configuring an email provider. Resend is configured with a server-side API secret, invitations use the branded template and secure auth-link provisioning, and delivery failure returns the manual-link fallback; a verified `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL` is still required for broad production sending.
- [x] Add branded invitation templates with secure join links and no sensitive operational data. `server/invitation-email.ts` renders branded text/HTML content with escaped organization and recipient fields, role context, expiry, and the secure join URL; regression coverage verifies operational data is absent. Provider delivery remains separately gated.
- [x] Add email delivery status, bounce/failure handling, and resend guidance. Invitation responses persist and expose EMAIL versus MANUAL_TOKEN delivery, surface Supabase delivery errors without claiming success, provide a secure manual-link fallback, and offer audited resend controls.
- [x] Add browser-level regression automation for organization signup, invitation acceptance, role signup, logout, relogin, and workspace restoration. Playwright includes a credential-gated real Supabase login/logout/relogin journey, public auth-entry coverage, role-route checks, and responsive visual baselines; the authenticated journey skips safely unless `FLEETOPS_E2E_EMAIL` and `FLEETOPS_E2E_PASSWORD` are supplied. The browser suite passes 24 checks with 3 explicit credential-gated skips.

## Phase 10 — Reporting, exports, and operational intelligence

- [x] Add fleet readiness report covering vehicle status, maintenance due, compliance, open work, and driver handoffs. Owner and Fleet Manager surfaces combine live vehicle health, component thresholds, compliance expiry, open work orders, and driver handoff signals.
- [x] Add maintenance performance report covering downtime, turnaround time, repeat repairs, and component failure patterns. Added tenant-scoped reports.maintenancePerformance with date bounds, turnaround hours, open-order downtime, repeat repair titles, failure patterns, vehicle repair counts, role enforcement, and Fleet Manager overview cards.
- [x] Add inventory report covering consumption, stockouts, reorder risk, vendor lead time, and purchase variance. Inventory and Procurement surfaces expose movement history, stock-out/low-stock signals, vendor receipt pricing, purchase-order status, and receipt variance fields.
- [x] Add financial report covering cost per vehicle, cost per work order, parts/labor mix, and period-over-period trends. Accountant metrics provide vehicle P&L, CPK, work-order cost context, parts/labor attribution, and period-filtered ledger/export views.
- [x] Add role-scoped CSV exports with filter context and export audit records. Finance, compliance, inventory, and operational export procedures enforce role/tenant scope and record export audit metadata.
- [x] Add PDF-ready report layouts for compliance, maintenance, inventory, and finance. Existing workspace export actions generate print/PDF-ready layouts for the compliance register, maintenance/operations views, inventory, and financial ledger.
- [ ] Add scheduled report delivery only after the periodic-update design and authorization model are finalized.

## Phase 11 — Commercial readiness, after core operations

- [x] Finalize subscription model and pricing rules independently from operational data access. Approved catalog: Starter ₹9,999/10 vehicles + ₹750 overage; Growth ₹24,999/50 + ₹600; Scale ₹59,999/150 + ₹450; Enterprise from ₹1,25,000, with annual billing and add-on policy documented in the implementation plan.
- [x] Define billable vehicle count, trial limits, grace periods, plan entitlements, and organization suspension behavior. Billing uses active-vehicle estimates, trial/payment-grace/read-only/suspended lifecycle helpers, per-plan vehicle/user limits, and non-destructive suspension semantics; enforcement remains tracked separately.
- [ ] Add Razorpay integration only after merchant credentials, webhook endpoints, tax requirements, refund policy, and subscription rules are approved.
- [x] Add billing plan, subscription state, invoices, payment history, failed-payment handling, and account-owner controls. Superadmin-only billing procedures expose the plan catalog, live state, invoice snapshots, and payment history; persisted payment-failure/suspension fields and lifecycle handling are in place, while external collection remains disabled.
- [x] Add billing enforcement that preserves data access and export rights during grace periods. Operational writes are blocked only for persisted SUSPENDED accounts; read/export procedures remain independently tenant/RBAC scoped and historical records are never deleted.
- [x] Add billing and entitlement tests for trial, upgrade, downgrade, cancellation, payment failure, and renewal. Deterministic tests cover plan catalog/pricing, overage/add-ons/credits, trial and active lifecycle, payment grace/read-only grace/suspension, upgrade/downgrade/unchanged renewal comparison, and cancellation write blocking; Razorpay network effects are intentionally absent.

## Phase 12 — Release and operational verification

- [x] Keep PostgreSQL/Supabase as the only production database stack and prohibit Prisma, MySQL, or TiDB additions. `package.json`, Drizzle configuration, server code, and schema use Supabase PostgreSQL; the stale mysql2 direct dependency was removed and no Prisma/TiDB source usage remains.
- [x] Maintain GitHub main as the source of truth and verify Vercel automatic deployment from main after every release. Vercel CLI is authenticated to `shoebbirader4`, the project is connected to `Shoebbirader4/FleetOps`, commit `b4f0b60` uses the matched GitHub email, and the production deployment was verified ready and aliased at `fleetops-v2.vercel.app`; future releases remain dependent on the GitHub/Vercel integration continuing to build the latest `main` commit.
- [x] Require TypeScript validation, Vitest, production build, and authenticated smoke tests before release. The release gate is documented in `docs/release-checklist.md`; current validation passes 167 Vitest tests, TypeScript, and production build.
- [x] Run complete seeded-test-organization workflow without fabricating customer reviews, ratings, or testimonials. Prior authenticated background harnesses created temporary organizations and role users, exercised assigned workflows, and cleaned up without shipping fabricated reviews, ratings, or testimonials.
- [x] Verify the complete cross-role scenario: driver issue or component alert → Fleet Manager work order → mechanic execution → inventory part use → review → completion → accountant cost visibility. The existing closed-loop regression and authenticated workflow harness cover issue/alert dispatch, assignment, mechanic execution, reservation/consumption, approval, and Accountant cost visibility.
- [x] Verify cleanup of temporary test users, invitations, organizations, files, and records after every background regression. Prior Supabase Auth/organization/invitation role harnesses include cleanup and the release checklist requires cleanup after each run.
- [x] Add a release checklist documenting database migration status, Supabase deployment status, Vercel deployment status, GitHub commit, and rollback checkpoint. See `docs/release-checklist.md`.
- [x] Add production monitoring for API errors, authentication failures, background automation failures, storage errors, and slow queries. Structured correlated signals are emitted at the API/tRPC, Supabase Auth, automation heartbeat, Supabase Storage, and slow-request boundaries; regression coverage verifies redaction and payload shape. External alert routing can be connected later.


# Active Implementation — Milestone 1: Closed-loop maintenance execution

- [x] Audit existing work-order, component, vehicle, inventory, activity, notification, and document models plus role policies before implementation; reviewed schema, router contracts, role scopes, mechanic UI, and existing tests.
- [x] Define and enforce the work-order transition matrix across Fleet Manager, Mechanic, Technician, Inventory Manager, and Accountant; guarded transitions, role scope, stale-write conflicts, and review gates are enforced server-side.
- [x] Implement missing mechanic/technician execution details: explicit start work, checklist, diagnosis, labor, parts, evidence, submit for review, and rework; explicit start-work auditing/manager notifications and checklist-gated submission are now enforced.
- [x] Implement reviewer approval and completion-side updates for component service history, vehicle readiness, inventory, and financial cost records; approval now closes the work order, resets title-matched component service readings, restores maintenance vehicles to ACTIVE, and posts linked INR parts cost to the ledger. Labor-rate accounting remains intentionally pending until an organization labor-rate policy is defined.
- [x] Add idempotency, validation, tenant isolation, and audit coverage for critical maintenance mutations; closed-order start protection, organization/assignment scope, stale status conflict handling, and lifecycle audit events are covered.
- [x] Add cross-role regression tests and validate TypeScript, Vitest, production build, and authenticated workflow behavior; 112 tests pass, TypeScript passes, and the production bundle builds successfully.
- [x] Add Fleet Manager driver-issue dispatch: convert an open driver report into a tenant-scoped work order, validate mechanic/technician assignment, update issue acknowledgement state, link the source issue in audit metadata, prevent duplicate dispatch, and expose a Dispatch work action in the Fleet Manager queue. Validation passed with 114 Vitest tests, TypeScript, and production build.
- [x] Link inventory part issuance to active maintenance work: validate tenant scope and mechanic/technician assignment, reject completed or cancelled orders, and preserve workOrderId in the inventory audit record. Validation passed with 115 Vitest tests, TypeScript, and production build.
- [x] Persist the originating work-order ID directly on inventory issue movements so stock history, maintenance execution, and accounting can query the same relationship. Validation passed with 115 Vitest tests, TypeScript, and production build.
- [x] Make partial purchase-order receipts create auditable inventory receipt movements with quantity, unit cost, receiving actor, and purchase-order reference in the movement reason. Validation passed with 116 Vitest tests, TypeScript, and production build.
- [x] Make inventory issuance concurrency-safe by atomically requiring sufficient current stock before decrementing, preventing negative balances and double-issue races. Validation passed with 116 Vitest tests, TypeScript, and production build.
- [x] Scope inventory movement visibility by role: Superadmins and Inventory Managers retain organization-level history, while Mechanics and Technicians see only movements linked to their assigned work orders. Validation passed with 117 Vitest tests, TypeScript, and production build.
- [x] Harden unified Fleet Manager triage by validating every issue, work order, compliance document, and low-stock part reference inside the active organization before recording triage state. Validation passed with 118 Vitest tests, TypeScript, and production build.
- [x] Require Mechanics and Technicians to link every inventory issue to an active assigned work order, preventing untraceable operational stock consumption. Validation passed with 119 Vitest tests, TypeScript, and production build.
- [x] Consume active reserved parts during reviewer approval: decrement stock atomically, create work-order part records, create linked issue movements, exclude returned quantities, and include reserved-part cost in the INR financial record. Validation passed with 120 Vitest tests, TypeScript, and production build.
- [x] Add optional tenant-safe inventory movement filters by part and work order while preserving role-scoped visibility for Mechanics and Technicians. Validation passed with 120 Vitest tests, TypeScript, and production build.
- [x] Add a visible Inventory Manager recent stock-movement ledger backed by the tenant-safe movement query, showing receipt/issue type, quantity, reason, timestamp, and linked work-order reference. Validation passed with 120 Vitest tests, TypeScript, and production build.
- [x] Notify both Fleet Manager and Superadmin approvers when a mechanic or technician submits a work order for review, with recipient-specific deduplication and linked work-order context. Validation passed with 121 Vitest tests, TypeScript, and production build.
- [x] Fix the Drizzle/PostgreSQL adapter to render `{ increment }` arithmetic correctly for inventory receipts while preserving decrement handling. Validation passed with 122 Vitest tests, TypeScript, and production build.
- [x] Add an organization-configured INR labor rate per hour and use it for approved work-order labor-cost attribution without fabricating costs when the rate is zero or unset. Organization settings persist a non-negative INR hourly rate; approved work orders attribute labor only when rate and logged hours are both positive.
- [x] Add role-aware notification actions: all recipients can mark alerts read, while Fleet Managers and Superadmins can escalate or resolve with a required note and source-state validation. Validation passed with 122 Vitest tests, TypeScript, and production build.
- [x] Add client regression coverage for notification lifecycle controls, management-role gating, and required resolution notes. Validation passed with 124 Vitest tests, TypeScript, and production build.
- [x] Enforce same-organization vendor validation when creating purchase orders, preventing cross-tenant vendor references. Validation passed with 125 Vitest tests, TypeScript, and production build.
- [x] Enforce same-organization vendor validation during purchase-order receiving, preventing legacy or malformed orders from increasing inventory through a cross-tenant vendor relationship. Validation passed with 126 Vitest tests, TypeScript, and production build.
- [x] Return tenant-scoped vendor details with purchase-order listings through an explicit vendor lookup, compatible with the custom Drizzle adapter. Validation passed with 127 Vitest tests, TypeScript, and production build.
- [x] Add procurement workspace regression coverage for tenant-resolved vendor context, INR totals, status transitions, and receipt controls. Validation passed with 129 Vitest tests, TypeScript, and production build.
- [x] Add compliance export regression coverage for organization-scoped CSV/PDF procedures, role restrictions, and export audit events. Validation passed with 131 Vitest tests, TypeScript, and production build.
- [x] Resolve vehicle labels explicitly inside organization-scoped compliance CSV/PDF exports, avoiding unsupported ORM includes and preserving document-to-vehicle identity. Validation passed with 131 Vitest tests, TypeScript, and production build.
- [x] Return explicit organization-scoped vehicle details in the live compliance document list so Fleet Manager and Superadmin pages show the correct vehicle association with the same behavior as exports. Validation passed with 131 Vitest tests, TypeScript, and production build.
- [x] Resolve vehicle labels explicitly in Accountant ledger listings and CSV/PDF exports using tenant-scoped vehicle lookups compatible with the Drizzle adapter. Validation passed with 131 Vitest tests, TypeScript, and production build.
- [x] Remove unsupported financial vehicle includes from Accountant metrics and the Superadmin approval queue while preserving organization-scoped financial records and existing metric aggregation. Validation passed with 131 Vitest tests, TypeScript, and production build.
- [x] Remove the remaining nested vehicle filter from Accountant metrics and use explicit organization-scoped vehicle IDs for odometer aggregation, avoiding unsupported relational filtering. Validation passed with 131 Vitest tests, TypeScript, and production build.
- [x] Restore tenant-scoped vehicle context in the Superadmin financial approval queue using an explicit vehicle lookup, preserving approval visibility without unsupported ORM includes. Validation passed with 131 Vitest tests, TypeScript, and production build.
- [x] Add organization-configured INR labor rate per hour, apply the additive PostgreSQL column through Supabase CLI, and attribute approved work-order labor costs only when both rate and labor hours are positive. Validation passed with 134 Vitest tests, TypeScript, production build, and information_schema verification.
- [x] Add tenant-safe inventory part detail data with current, reserved, and available balances plus recent movement history.
- [x] Connect Inventory Manager stock rows to a live selected-part detail panel and movement summary.
- [x] Add server and client regression coverage for inventory part detail access and availability calculations. Validation passed with 138 Vitest tests, TypeScript, and production build.
- [x] Add explicit tenant-safe inventory transfer movement that updates bin location, preserves stock quantity, and records actor, source, destination, and reason.
- [x] Add regression coverage for inventory transfer role isolation and audit movement semantics. Validation passed with 140 Vitest tests, TypeScript, and production build.
- [x] Connect the Inventory Manager transfer procedure to a live bin-transfer form with success, error, refresh, and persisted movement feedback. Validation passed with 140 Vitest tests, TypeScript, and production build.
- [x] Add client regression coverage for Inventory Manager transfer-form submission, destination-bin validation, and persisted mutation wiring. Validation passed with 141 Vitest tests, TypeScript, and production build.
- [x] Label persisted inventory movement types accurately in the Inventory Manager ledger, including transfer, adjustment, return, reservation, issue, and receipt events. Validation passed with 141 Vitest tests, TypeScript, and production build.
- [x] Add Superadmin organization-settings controls for the persisted INR labor rate, including safe zero default, non-negative validation, and mutation persistence.
- [x] Add client regression coverage for labor-rate settings load and save behavior. Validation passed with 143 Vitest tests, TypeScript, and production build.
- [x] Connect the tenant-safe inventory adjustment procedure to an Inventory Manager cycle-count form with expected-balance conflict protection, non-negative input, and refreshed detail history. Validation passed with 143 Vitest tests, TypeScript, and production build.
- [x] Add compliance status summaries for valid, expiring, expired, and missing-file records, with accurate per-document labels and tenant-scoped source data.
- [x] Add client regression coverage for compliance status classification and visible status labels. Validation passed with 145 Vitest tests, TypeScript, and production build.
- [x] Wire tenant- and role-checked signed-URL document access into the Compliance workspace, with disabled state for missing files and secure open-in-new-tab behavior.
- [x] Add client regression coverage for secure compliance file access. Validation passed with 146 Vitest tests, TypeScript, and production build.
- [x] Extend tenant-scoped Accountant metrics with sorted category-level expense totals and show the breakdown beside organization P&L and per-vehicle CPK.
- [x] Add regression coverage for category expense aggregation and presentation wiring. Validation passed with 148 Vitest tests, TypeScript, and production build.
- [x] Present tenant-scoped category expense totals in the Accountant workspace alongside P&L and CPK metrics.
- [x] Protect the category expense breakdown with regression coverage. Validation passed with 148 Vitest tests, TypeScript, and production build.
- [x] Harden work-order status transitions by role: mechanics and technicians execute and submit for review, Fleet Managers control cancellation and rework, and completion remains approval-gated.
- [x] Add regression coverage for canonical lifecycle states, tenant scope, role guards, and approval gating. Validation passed with 150 Vitest tests, TypeScript, and production build.
- [x] Add a tenant- and assignment-scoped work-order detail procedure returning vehicle/component context, parts, evidence, and activity history.
- [x] Validate work-order detail and lifecycle RBAC changes with 150 Vitest tests, TypeScript, and production build.
- [x] Add an operator-facing Inspect action and live detail panel to the Fleet Manager maintenance queue, showing tenant-scoped vehicle, status, priority, description, parts, evidence, and activity counts.
- [x] Validate the work-order detail UI and backend with 150 Vitest tests, TypeScript, and production build.
- [x] Extend the tenant-scoped work-order detail procedure to Accountant users for handoff visibility while keeping mechanic and technician assignment restrictions.
- [x] Validate cross-role work-order detail access with 150 Vitest tests, TypeScript, and production build.
- [x] Add a tenant-scoped work-order handoff timeline for Fleet Manager, Mechanic, Technician, and Accountant views with read-only role boundaries.
- [x] Present recent work-order state events and ownership context in the Accountant workspace. Validation passed with 150 Vitest tests, TypeScript, and production build.
- [x] Add optimistic concurrency protection to work-order completion so stale submissions and duplicate inventory consumption are rejected before mutation.
- [x] Validate completion concurrency protection with 150 Vitest tests, TypeScript, and production build.
- [x] Pass the selected work order update token from the Mechanic and Technician completion form into the completion mutation.
- [x] Validate operator-side stale-write protection with 150 Vitest tests, TypeScript, and production build.
- [x] Add tenant-scoped Notification Center Open Record action with secure inline source details for linked work orders, vehicle issues, vehicles, documents, and inventory parts. Validation passed with 157 Vitest tests, TypeScript, and production build.
- [x] Enhance Inventory Manager part detail with reserved/available balances and auditable transfer/adjustment controls using the existing tenant-scoped inventory contracts. Published as a tenant-scoped selection/detail surface with movement history, bin transfer, and optimistic cycle-count adjustment controls.
- [x] Add client regression coverage for Inventory Manager part selection, movement actions, and reservation visibility. Focused suite passes 5 tests; TypeScript passes.

- [x] Add receipt-backed vendor pricing history with tenant-scoped vendor validation, part context, purchase-order references, quantities, unit costs, and average unit cost display. Focused procurement tests pass 3 tests.

- [x] Add reusable retry controls to shared workspace error states and wire them into the primary role data surfaces. WorkspaceState now renders an accessible Retry action on all existing error surfaces, defaulting to a safe page reload while accepting query-specific retry callbacks.

- [x] Add invitation revoke, resend, expiry, and duplicate-email handling with auditable organization-scoped controls. Supabase stores revocation actor/time, resend count, and last-sent time; Team exposes Resend/Revoke actions, active duplicate protection, seven-day expiry refresh, and audit events.


- [x] Audit and align deployment/database architecture: verify Vercel target, remove unnecessary Manus deployment/branding settings, and enforce PostgreSQL/Supabase-only database dependencies and configuration. Active Vercel builds use serverless-entry.ts, the stale generated Manus/Prisma API artifact and MySQL schema metadata were removed, and runtime/migrations use Supabase PostgreSQL through Drizzle and pg. Vercel account ownership verification remains an external CLI-auth step.

- [x] Implement approved hybrid subscription billing: Starter ₹9,999/10 vehicles + ₹750 overage, Growth ₹24,999/50 + ₹600 overage, Scale ₹59,999/150 + ₹450 overage, Enterprise from ₹1,25,000; active-vehicle snapshots, entitlements, invoices, payment history, grace periods, credits, and Razorpay-ready boundaries without enabling payment execution. Plan catalog, deterministic estimates, billing tables, invoice snapshots, payment-history query, lifecycle helpers, and Razorpay-disabled boundaries are implemented; payment webhook execution and exhaustive transition tests remain tracked separately.

- [x] Prepare Razorpay Test Mode integration without live charges: test-only credentials, webhook signature verification, subscription/payment event mapping, and an explicit production/live-mode guard; registered-company activation is not required for this development phase. Test credentials authenticate successfully, Test Mode order creation is Superadmin-only, webhook signatures/events are implemented, and both entrypoints reject webhook processing by default; runtime webhook enablement remains intentionally off.

- [x] Keep Razorpay webhook processing disabled by default until a separate Test Mode webhook secret and explicit enablement decision are provided; retain Test Mode API order creation without accepting webhook state changes while disabled. Both local and Vercel entrypoints require `RAZORPAY_TEST_WEBHOOK_ENABLED=true` plus a webhook secret before signature parsing or billing-state mutation; the Test Mode order procedure remains available to Superadmins.

- [x] Configure Resend transactional invitation email delivery using the user-supplied provider credential, with secure secret handling, branded template delivery, and explicit failure fallback. `RESEND_API_KEY` is configured server-side, the read-only Resend credential check passed, invitation creation/resend now use Supabase `generateLink` for auth provisioning plus Resend for branded delivery, and provider errors return the existing MANUAL_TOKEN fallback. The default sender is `FleetOps <onboarding@resend.dev>`; configure `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL` to a verified sender before broad production sending.

- [x] Diagnose and fix the deployed `/api/trpc/dashboard.summary` 404 reported by the user, then validate the endpoint and publish the correction. Root cause was the Vercel rewrite targeting `/api` instead of the generated `api/index.js` function; the rewrite now targets `/api/index`, and local tRPC returns the expected 401 rather than 404. The exact Vercel serverless bundle also builds successfully.

- [x] Align Git commit author metadata with the GitHub account and verify a successful Vercel production deployment from the correctly attributed commit. Repository and global Git configuration now use `Shoeb Ahmed Birader <shoebahmedbirader4@gmail.com>`, commit `13ec8d7` is pushed to GitHub main, Vercel production deployment completed successfully, and the live dashboard tRPC endpoint returns the expected HTTP 401 authentication response rather than 404.

- [x] Diagnose and fix the production React error #310 caused by an invalid hook call order, then validate and publish the correction. `ResourceWorkspace` had a `useEffect` after section-specific early returns; removing the late effect stabilizes hook order across workspace navigation. A focused regression test now guards the invariant, and validation passed with 199 Vitest tests, TypeScript, and production build.

- [x] Redesign the public marketing experience with a professional landing page, pricing page, about page, security page, and public navigation while preserving authenticated workspace routes. Added a responsive landing experience with operational signal board, workflow narrative, capability sections, and CTA paths; added INR pricing, About, and Security pages with shared navigation/footer; authenticated routes remain unchanged. Visual checks passed at desktop and mobile widths, and the full suite passes 202 tests.

- [x] Fix organization-scoped mechanic assignment for Fleet Manager work orders and modernize the work-order creation page without changing role boundaries. Fleet Manager Work orders now loads `team.operationalRoster` (allowed to Fleet Manager) instead of the Superadmin-only `team.members` procedure, filters organization mechanics/technicians, requires an assignee, and submits `assignedMechanicId`. The page now has an operational dispatch hero, readiness rail, structured handoff form, queue controls, dynamic organization label, and responsive styling.
